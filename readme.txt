ReactWoo Support Portal

This repository contains the ReactWoo Support Portal WordPress plugin scaffold.
It provides database tables and REST endpoints for subscription-bound site
onboarding, token verification, and client identity synchronization.
It also registers subscription lifecycle hooks (including payment-failed grace
period handling) and scheduled cleanup for expired enrollment tokens.
